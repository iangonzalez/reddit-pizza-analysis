# Analysis of Online Pizza Altruism

This repository contains my machine learning-driven analysis of data from the subreddit r/randomactsofpizza. This code and the subsequent writeup were created for the relevant kaggle competition (see https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza) and as a final project for STAT 365 at Yale. Note that much of the code/analysis is reproducing the results achieved in the academic paper linked to in the kaggle competition. 


## The Code

All the code and .rda files generated by the code used for the analysis are in the `/R` directory. The main analysis code is all in `pizza_analysis_final.R` -- it's separated into sections with comments. Note that this code expects the current working directory to be the `/R` directory in order for file paths to work.

### Required packages

The following R packages are required to run all of the code:
 - rjson
 - NLP
 - openNLP
 - clValid
 - lda
 - qdap
 - adabag
 - ROCR


## Methods and Results of Analysis

See the writeup pdf in the `/writeup` directory for full details on the methods used here and the results.
